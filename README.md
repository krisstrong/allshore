# AllShore — Demo Power BI Dashboard

**AllShore** is a demo Power BI dashboard created by Kris Strong to showcase a clean, business-focused reporting prototype suitable for an analytics team or executive audience.

> **For best results:** download the Power BI file (.pbix) in the `power_bi/` folder or open the included PDF report (`example_allshore_power_bi.pdf`). The interactive Power BI file will provide the full experience; the PDF is provided as a high-fidelity alternative.

## Quick start — view the report

1. **Download the `.pbix` file** from the `power_bi/` directory and open it with **Power BI Desktop** (recommended) to interact with filters, tooltips, and drill-throughs.
2. If you don’t have Power BI Desktop, download `example_allshore_power_bi.pdf` for a static, printable version of the dashboard.

### Recommended environment

## Data
This project uses a sample HR dataset sourced from Kaggle: [HR Dataset v14 by Brahim Anis Belferkou](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brahimanisbelferkou/hrdataset-v14). The data is synthetic and used purely for demonstration of ETL, modelling, and visualization patterns.

---

## Notes for reviewers
- The `.pbix` file contains the full data model, measures, and visual interactions. For assessing filtering, measure logic, and drill behavior, open the `.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
- The PDF provides the same visual layout and narrative flow but does not include interactive elements like slicers or tooltips.
